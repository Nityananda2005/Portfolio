### Styling Customization

#### Colors
The website uses CSS custom properties for easy color customization. Update the variables in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;      /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #f59e0b;    /* Accent color */
    --text-primary: #1f2937;       /* Main text color */
    --text-secondary: #6b7280;     /* Secondary text color */
    /* ... other colors */
}
```

#### Typography
The website uses Google Fonts (Inter and Poppins). You can change fonts by:
1. Updating the Google Fonts link in `index.html`
2. Modifying the font-family properties in `styles.css`

#### Animations
Customize animations by modifying:
- Animation durations in CSS
- Scroll trigger points in JavaScript
- Parallax speeds and effects

### JavaScript Customization

#### Typing Animation
Update the roles array in `script.js`:
```javascript
const roles = [
    'Your Role 1',
    'Your Role 2',
    'Your Role 3',
    'Your Role 4'
];
```

#### Contact Form
The contact form currently simulates submission. To make it functional:
1. Replace the setTimeout in `handleContactForm()` with actual form submission
2. Add your preferred form handling service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.)

#### Theme Persistence
The theme preference is saved in localStorage. You can modify the default theme by changing the fallback in `loadTheme()`.
